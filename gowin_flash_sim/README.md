### LiteX / Verilator simulation of AHB Flash access by Gowin EMCU Arm core

Uses `GW1N verilog functional simulation library` included in Gowin IDE, patched for compatibility with Verilator.

Run `GOWIN_SDK=/path/to/gowin/ide make` to run a simulation, then `make gtkwave` to inspect the simulated waveforms.
